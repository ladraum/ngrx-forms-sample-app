# SimpleFormApplication

This sample application was built to demonstrate the use of `ngrx-forms` to add custom validation to forms, and control it's state in the `@ngrx/store`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
